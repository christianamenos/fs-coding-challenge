# Yoga Solo -  Full Stack code challenge

## Original challenge

* [README copy](INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Description

This is an implementation for the FullStack challenge proposed by the YogaSolo team.

This solution is divided in different repositories to allow more independence between the different technology stacks. The details for each stack are describen in the `README` file of each repository.

The stacks run on separate dockers. The following stacks are available:
* [Front-end](https://github.com/christianamenos/ys_fs_front): it uses Angular to create a Single Page Application. I chose Angular because I'm more familiar with the technology, and I have already risked implementation time with the back-end and operational technologies.
* [Back-end](https://github.com/christianamenos/ys_fs_back): it uses SpringBoot with Kotlin. I chose these technologies because I wanted to learn a bit about them, and I thought it could be interesting way to test them. I think it also aligns with demand on the market.
* [Database](https://github.com/christianamenos/mongodb): I chose MongoDB as the database for the project, because it's a powerful relational database, and it adds flexibility on the schema in case I wanted to perform some changes in any of the databases used. I was also interested on defining a MongoDB image, and how to manage it with docker.

In order to run the solution, it will require to have a macOS machine with the following software installed:
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_es)
* [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
* [MongoDB CLI commands](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
